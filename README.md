🧠 About Me

I’m an AI engineering student with hands-on experience in computer vision, large language models, and backend AI systems.
I enjoy building real-world AI applications through hackathons, internships, and open-source projects.

I work mainly with YOLOv8, RAG pipelines, FastAPI, Docker, and modern ML tools.
